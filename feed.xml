<p>We heard and contributed to different sessions around implementing Beacon for <a href="https://www.icgc-argo.org/">ICGC-ARGO</a> and the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/government-canada-invests-15m-first-its-kind-pan-canadian-genome-library-352299">Pan Canadian Genome Library</a> (PCGL), as well as work the Regulatory and Ethics working group is initiating. Jon talked about our work on Overture and I presented the new PCGL project to the Steering Committee, highlighting connections between PCGL and GA4GH, with my colleagues David Bujold and Ma’n Zawaati. Slides for the PCGL GA4GH intro are available <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qTeVxbrYqvLw_HsaNENYwCQpfDM44ed9SlrNmdoTEio/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

This project seeks to move the ICGC ARGO datasets across to the Digital Research Alliance of Canada (Alliance) cloud by leveraging DRAC cloud hosting up to 4PB.</p>

<p>As part of the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR) mission to develop safer and more effective therapeutic strategies, the International Cancer Genome Consortium for Accelerating Research in Genomic Oncology (ICGC ARGO) plays a crucial role in creating diagnostic assays, monitoring tumor evolution, and developing clinical decision algorithms for clinicians to stay ahead of the tumor’s next move.
ICGC ARGO achieves this by leveraging big data and global collaboration to create a comprehensive knowledge base of cancer genomes and clinical annotations from over 100,000 patients enrolled in international therapeutic clinical trials. OICR co-leads the ICGC ARGO project, allowing Canada to remain a global leader in managing and analyzing large cancer genomic datasets. The <a href="https://platform.icgc-argo.org/">ICGC ARGO Data Platform</a>, operated by OICR, collects, quality-controls, and harmonizes data produced by international ICGC ARGO participants, creating an intuitive Data Portal to distribute the knowledge generated by the project to the global research community.</p>

<p>In the coming year, we plan to move the ICGC ARGO datasets across to the Digital Research Alliance of Canada (Alliance) cloud. The specific aims of the project for the coming year will be organized into different activities:</p>

<p>● A1: Operate an ICGC Cloud Distribution Centre in the Alliance Cloud to provide the international cancer research community access to the ICGC ARGO data sets.
● A2: Expand this infrastructure for ICGC ARGO project data collection.</p>]]></content><author><name>melanie-courtot</name></author><category term="funding" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have been awarded a 3 year Digital Research Alliance of Canada award for the “ICGC ARGO datasets on Alliance Cloud” project.

<p>The VirusSeq Data Portal is an open-source and open-access portal for all Canadian SARS-CoV-2 sequences and associated non-personal contextual data. It harmonizes, validates, and automates submission to international databases. It is the first such open sequence database of its kind in Canada, providing additional metadata not available through any other resource. The resulting analyses by tools such as CAMEO’s Duotang have been seen as highly reliable and are used by Industry (e.g., AstraZeneca), researchers, and the media to aid investigations such as COVID-19 variant risk assessment.</p>

<p>In addition to the ongoing maintenance of the VirusSeq portal, and in collaboration with the national WWRG: CoVaRR-Net wastewater surveillance research group, we will initiate the integration of Canadian wastewater data, with a focus on the integration of regional variant frequencies and ensuring the appropriate metadata.</p>

<p>Integration of wastewater data, at least at the level of frequency of variants of concerns (VOCs) by province/territory, would be beneficial for a number of reasons, including</p>
<ol>
  <li>Wastewater data is an important complement to clinical-case based data, and leading indicator, delivering more serial, cost-effective, real-time assessments of entire populations/areas more comprehensively and with more inclusively (i.e. it is not limited to those with access to clinical testing),</li>
  <li>This incorporation of wastewater data will aid the integration of case-based data and associated contextual data (including more environmental data), aiding One Health investigations,</li>
  <li>This provides an important base for other initiatives and will support several prominent groups leading provincial wastewater analysis that are currently surveying, or have the capacity to survey, approximately 80% of their provincial populations.</li>
