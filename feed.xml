<p>The Genome Informatics team presented at the <a href="https://ohcrn.ca/">Ontario Hereditary Cancer Research Network (OHCRN)</a> Spring reconnect event.
OHCRN will collect clinical (patient ID, cancer status and type, pathology) and genomic (molecular report, sequencing information, virtual biobank) data for hereditary cancer patients in Ontario, and link this to external databases such as existing registries, Ontario Health/Cancer Care Ontario. The OHCRN Spring Reconnect meeting brought together members of the OHCRN community, researchers, Ontario Health, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (IC/ES), Indoc Research and other collaborators to share progress, challenges and ideas for the future of genomic data sharing in Ontario.</p>

Our summer intern, <a href="/members/pratham_hemlani.html">Pratham Hemlani</a>, supports the OHCRN project by exploring ways to (semi) automatically extract structured data from genomics lab report.

<p>Robin is highly committed to our success, and has been critical in securing funding, keeping in with deadlines, reporting on projects and overall ensuring my resources align with our deliverables.</p>

<p>Additionally, Robin leads many activities at OICR such as the Informatics retreat, TorBug or the Translational Research Conference.</p>

<p>Finally, Robin empower other members of the team. He mentors staff and joined the OICR mentorship program, working with other institute leaders to expand our Genome Informatics model across the institute. He is a member of the EDI committee, and unrelentingly advocates for equity and diversity in the teams and the institute.</p>

<p>Robin: thank you for everything you do in the team, at OICR and beyond.

This project seeks to move the ICGC ARGO datasets across to the Digital Research Alliance of Canada (Alliance) cloud by leveraging DRAC cloud hosting up to 4PB.</p>

<p>As part of the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research (OICR) mission to develop safer and more effective therapeutic strategies, the International Cancer Genome Consortium for Accelerating Research in Genomic Oncology (ICGC ARGO) plays a crucial role in creating diagnostic assays, monitoring tumor evolution, and developing clinical decision algorithms for clinicians to stay ahead of the tumor’s next move.
ICGC ARGO achieves this by leveraging big data and global collaboration to create a comprehensive knowledge base of cancer genomes and clinical annotations from over 100,000 patients enrolled in international therapeutic clinical trials. OICR co-leads the ICGC ARGO project, allowing Canada to remain a global leader in managing and analyzing large cancer genomic datasets. The <a href="https://platform.icgc-argo.org/">ICGC ARGO Data Platform</a>, operated by OICR, collects, quality-controls, and harmonizes data produced by international ICGC ARGO participants, creating an intuitive Data Portal to distribute the knowledge generated by the project to the global research community.</p>

<p>The VirusSeq Data Portal is an open-source and open-access portal for all Canadian SARS-CoV-2 sequences and associated non-personal contextual data. It harmonizes, validates, and automates submission to international databases. It is the first such open sequence database of its kind in Canada, providing additional metadata not available through any other resource. The resulting analyses by tools such as CAMEO’s Duotang have been seen as highly reliable and are used by Industry (e.g., AstraZeneca), researchers, and the media to aid investigations such as COVID-19 variant risk assessment.</p>

<p>In addition to the ongoing maintenance of the VirusSeq portal, and in collaboration with the national WWRG: CoVaRR-Net wastewater surveillance research group, we will initiate the integration of Canadian wastewater data, with a focus on the integration of regional variant frequencies and ensuring the appropriate metadata.</p>

<p>Integration of wastewater data, at least at the level of frequency of variants of concerns (VOCs) by province/territory, would be beneficial for a number of reasons, including</p>
<ol>
  <li>Wastewater data is an important complement to clinical-case based data, and leading indicator, delivering more serial, cost-effective, real-time assessments of entire populations/areas more comprehensively and with more inclusively (i.e. it is not limited to those with access to clinical testing),</li>
  <li>This incorporation of wastewater data will aid the integration of case-based data and associated contextual data (including more environmental data), aiding One Health investigations,</li>
  <li>This provides an important base for other initiatives and will support several prominent groups leading provincial wastewater analysis that are currently surveying, or have the capacity to survey, approximately 80% of their provincial populations.</li>
