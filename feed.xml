<p>We heard and contributed to differnt sessions around implementing Beacon for <a href="https://www.icgc-argo.org/">ICGC-ARGO</a> and the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/government-canada-invests-15m-first-its-kind-pan-canadian-genome-library-352299">Pan Canadian Genome Library</a> (PCGL), as well as work the Regulatory and Ethics working group is initiating. Jon talked about our work on Overture and I presented the new PCGL project to the Steering Committee, highlighting connections between PCGL and GA4GH, with my colleagues David Bujold and Maâ€™n Zawaati. Slides for the PCGL GA4GH intro are available <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qTeVxbrYqvLw_HsaNENYwCQpfDM44ed9SlrNmdoTEio/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
