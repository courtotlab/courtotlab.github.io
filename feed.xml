Currently, I am an intern at the Ontario Institute of Cancer Research (OICR) under Genome Informatics. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shailikadakia">You can connect with me here if you‚Äôd like to connect or chat more!</a> This past October, I attended the Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC) in Philadelphia.

I wanted to share some of the key moments that left a lasting impact on me.</p>

<p>One of the most inspirational sessions I attended was <strong>Building a New Digital Age for AI</strong> by Amanda Renteria, CEO of Code for America. Amanda spoke about the <em>get CalFresh app</em>, a project that transformed the food stamps application process in California, making it possible for people to apply in under ten minutes. Originally, this process required navigating a 52-page, desktop-only form that was inaccessible for many. Amanda‚Äôs focus on ensuring technology works for everyone, and her dedication to good policy paired with effective implementation, was incredibly motivating. As I intern at OICR, this kind of thoughtful, impactful work is something I hope to contribute.</p>

<p>I also attended the <strong>Citadel Boundless Event</strong>, featuring Judit Polg√°r, one of the greatest chess players of all time. Judit spoke about her upbringing and her parents‚Äô decision to not let her compete in girls-only tournaments, instead encouraging her to compete in open, often male- dominated, events. Growing up alongside her sisters, who were also chess players, Judit‚Äôs story was about more than just chess‚Äîit was about breaking barriers and challenging societal norms. Her emphasis on the importance of a supportive environment resonated with me as a minority in technology, and it made me think about how we still have many gendered associations that should be challenged.</p>

<p>One workshop that stood out to me was <strong>Using ML To Predict a Baby‚Äôs Birth Weight</strong> by Anubha Bhargava. Anubha, a new mother herself, walked us through how she built a model to predict a baby‚Äôs birth weight based on various features. Surprisingly, the father‚Äôs education level was one of the factors included in the model. Her personal journey inspired her to use data science to improve healthcare outcomes, illustrating how our experiences can fuel creativity and lead to impactful solutions. This session made me realize that life experience adds depth to our problem-solving abilities, making our lived experiences invaluable assets in our work.</p>

<p>The workshop that made me laugh the most was <strong>I Ain‚Äôt Afraid of No Ghost Products</strong> by Haley Henderson and Malone Rachel Gregory. They presented the content with a fun Halloween theme, complete with ghosts and zombies, which made the message of <em>ghost products</em> really stick and kept the lessons both memorable and entertaining. One surprising statistic they shared was that 88% of people are less likely to return to a site after a bad experience‚Äîwhich really highlights how crucial it is to keep improving our products, no matter the challenges. They used hilarious examples, like the <em>smart toaster</em>‚Äîasking if it was really necessary‚Äîand the <em>smart fridge</em>, where they explored how it could be improved to better meet the needs of parents or single adults. For example, they suggested adding practical features like integrated calendars for parents or even games to keep kids entertained. This session really made me think about how vital it is to understand the problem fully before diving into solutions and reminded me of the diverse needs our users might have.</p>

<p>Overall, attending GHC this year was a journey that embodied grit, heart, and courage‚Äînot just in the stories that were shared, but in the way the community came together to inspire one another. The theme of <strong>Me + We</strong> was evident throughout: it reminded me that while individual grit and courage are essential, it is our collective heart and support for one another that truly drives meaningful change. I left GHC feeling empowered to not only grow myself but also to contribute to the growth of those around me.</p>

<p>It was both terrifying and exciting to be given such an opportunity; we rarely get 1h to discuss our research and topics of interests. I spent an enormous amount of time preparing (there are still post-its all over the walls of my office nook!) as I really wanted to describe my data journey and where I think it is important we, as an open source community, focus our efforts: ‚Äúwith great models, comes great data responsibility‚Äù. In particular I wanted to advocate for the need to make our data TRUE - Tracked, Reasonable, Understandable and Ethical. This is a pillar in my lab‚Äôs <a href="https://courtotlab.genomeinformatics.org/research/">research topics</a> and I believe will be fundamental in making our data AI-ready and maximally reusable to drive biological insights.</p>

<p>Preparing this keynote talk was very energizing as I had the chance to really think about what matters to me today, and where I want to take my research moving forward. It was also nostalgic looking back over my data journey and thinking about the amazing collaborators who have inspired me through the years and continue to do so today. While in some (or many!) cases our paths have diverged, I am really thankful for their input over the last 20 years. I am sure I omitted someone (isn‚Äôt it always dreadful to make an acknowledgement slide and realize you may forget a name‚Ä¶): I have truly benefitted from so many exceptional interactions that I couldn‚Äôt even hope to come close to mentioning everybody.</p>

<p>I do want to mention 3 incredible scientists that have been guides, mentors and friends:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.brinkman.mbb.sfu.ca/fiona-brinkman">Fiona Brinkman</a> was my post-doctoral fellowhip‚Äôs supervisor at Simon Fraser University. She gave me a first inside peek at what it means to be a PI and continues to awe me with her ongoing drive.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Haendel">Melissa Haendel</a> is an amazing role model. We worked together on many projects, and quite frankly, I don‚Äôt know how she does it all AND manages to support her colleagues and find time to provide feedback on life and science.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/people/person/helen-parkinson/">Helen Parkinson</a> is such a source of inspiration and so dedicated to make her team succeed; she taught me, amongst many other things, that being a good manager means supporting the people you work with, and making sure they have a path to success.</li>
</ul>

<p>As said during my presentation, if you ever have the chance to work with any of them just jump at the opportunity!</p>]]></content><author><name>melanie-courtot</name></author><category term="team," /><category term="meetings" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had the privilege of giving a keynote talk highlighting the importance of data quality, in particular in an AI/LLM world, at the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC), and with many thanks to the BOSC organizing committee and sponsors.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/images/news/BOSC_poster.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="/images/news/BOSC_poster.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">GA4GH Strategic Leadership Committee</title><link href="/2024/06/13/ga4gh-slc.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="GA4GH Strategic Leadership Committee" /><published>2024-06-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-05T21:13:05+00:00</updated><id>/2024/06/13/ga4gh-slc</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2024/06/13/ga4gh-slc.html"><![CDATA[<p>Dr Heidi Rehm, Global alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) chair, announced the <a href="https://www.ga4gh.org/news_item/a-letter-from-the-chair-introducing-the-members-of-the-inaugural-ga4gh-strategic-leadership-committee/">formation of the GA4GH Strategic Leadership Committee</a> and the appointment of its inaugural cohort of leaders.

<p>The Genome Informatics team presented at the <a href="https://ohcrn.ca/">Ontario Hereditary Cancer Research Network (OHCRN)</a> Spring reconnect event.
OHCRN will collect clinical (patient ID, cancer status and type, pathology) and genomic (molecular report, sequencing information, virtual biobank) data for hereditary cancer patients in Ontario, and link this to external databases such as existing registries, Ontario Health/Cancer Care Ontario. The OHCRN Spring Reconnect meeting brought together members of the OHCRN community, researchers, Ontario Health, Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (IC/ES), Indoc Research and other collaborators to share progress, challenges and ideas for the future of genomic data sharing in Ontario.</p>

<p>Robin is highly committed to our success, and has been critical in securing funding, keeping in with deadlines, reporting on projects and overall ensuring my resources align with our deliverables.</p>

<p>Additionally, Robin leads many activities at OICR such as the Informatics retreat, TorBug or the Translational Research Conference.</p>

<p>Finally, Robin empower other members of the team. He mentors staff and joined the OICR mentorship program, working with other institute leaders to expand our Genome Informatics model across the institute. He is a member of the EDI committee, and unrelentingly advocates for equity and diversity in the teams and the institute.</p>

<p>Robin: thank you for everything you do in the team, at OICR and beyond. You are an exceptional colleague and it is a great pleasure to see you being recognized with the Extra Mile award.</p>]]></content><author><name>melanie-courtot</name></author><category term="team" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Congratulations to Robin Haw on receiving the OICR Extra Mile award in recognition of his exceptional support to the team!]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="/images/news/extramile_award.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="/images/news/extramile_award.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome Pratham!</title><link href="/2024/05/06/welcome-pratham.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome Pratham!" /><published>2024-05-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-05T21:13:05+00:00</updated><id>/2024/05/06/welcome-pratham</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2024/05/06/welcome-pratham.html"><![CDATA[<p>The Courtot lab is hosting its first summer intern, <a href="/members/pratham_hemlani.html">Pratham Hemlani</a>.</p>
