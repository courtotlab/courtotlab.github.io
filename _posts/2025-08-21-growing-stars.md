Honestly, each of these news would deserve their own post, but it has been such a whirlwind of amazing successes from our lab 'growing stars'!


[Andr√©s Felipe Melani De La Hoz](/members/andres-melani-de-la-hoz.html) successfully passed his PhD Qualifying Exam! Andres is a PhD candidate in the Department of Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto. His project aims to create an AI-driven customizable framework that can identify, extract and process clinical data from unstructured sources. This will support logical reasoning and inference, generating relevant insights that can serve for patient treatment, disease diagnosis, or clinical trial matching.

Our summer students [Aaron Yu](/members/aaron-yu.html) and [Emma Purdie](/members/emma-purdie.html) spent the last few months working in the Courtot lab. Aaron and Emma each received an award for their research project (NSERC - Undergraduate Student Research Awards and Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program award respectively. They investigated new methods for automatic information extraction from documents and creating accessible summaries of research papers. They leave us on a high note, with Aaron just having won the prize for best poster at the MBP Summer student poster session.
