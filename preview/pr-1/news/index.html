        Hello, my name is Shaili and I am a 5th year double degree student at the University of Waterloo. Currently, I am an intern at the Ontario Institute of Cancer Research (OICR) under Genome Informatics. This past October, I attended the Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC) in Philadelphia. My experience was filled with inspirational, innovative, and insightful conversations. The theme of this year’s conference, Me + We perfectly captured the essence of what I experienced throughout the event. I wanted to share some of the key moments that left a lasting impact on me.
